      <h1>The Game</h1>
      <p>Planting a seed is a game about the journey of a small seed to find a place for it to sprout. It  is a single player 3D Navigational game, in which the player guides the seed along its journey to the center of a planet. Along the way, the player must traverse multiple layers of the planet, making use of the ability to reverse the gravitational forces to navigate to the next layer. 
      <br></br><br></br>
        On the path, the seed meets obstacles and hardship. To get to the center of the world, it has to get through the gates by collecting keys. However, the seedâ€™s energy supply is in danger, and thus the player must stay active and think quickly to survive the journey!   </p>
